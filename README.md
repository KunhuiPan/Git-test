# Computer Science and Programming in Python



## 1. Topics

- Represent knowledge with data structure
- Iteration and recursion as computational metaphors
- Abstraction of procedures and data types
- Organize and modulative systems using object classes and methods
- Different classes of algorithms, searching and sorting
- Complexity of algorithms



## 2. Objects

Programs manipulate data objects

- Objects are

  - Scalar (connot be subdivided)

  - Non-scalar (have internal structure that can be accessed)

- Scalar objects
  - int
  - float
  - bool
  - NoneType - special and has one value, None
  - can use type() to see the type of an object



## 3. Contents

- Branching and Iteration
  - strings
  - branching - if/elif/else
  - while loops
  - for loops
- sring manipulation guess-and-check approximations bisection
  - string manipulation
  - guess and check algorithms (exhaustive enumeration)
  - approximate solutions (start with a guess and increment by some small value)
  - bisection method (half interval each iteration, new guess is halfway in between)
